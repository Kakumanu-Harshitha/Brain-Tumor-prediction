# Brain-Tumor-prediction
# Description:
This dataset contains MRI scan images labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a brain tumor. It is suitable for binary classification tasks in medical image analysis.

# Key Features:

Image Data: High-resolution grayscale or colored MRI scans.

Labels:

Yes Tumor: Indicates the presence of a brain tumor.

No Tumor: Indicates no tumor is present.

File Structure: Organized into directories for training and testing, with subfolders for each label.
**Model Used**:
Here I used **Convoulution Neural Network** to predict whether MRI scan has a Brain Tumor or not.
